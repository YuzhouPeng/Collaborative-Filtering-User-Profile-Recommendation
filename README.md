# Collaborative-Filtering-User-Profile-Recommendation

# Design and Methodology of the Collaborative Filtering Approach
The design of collaborative filtering is shown in figure. We will introduce main components in the collaborative filtering approach:
Data preprocessing: In the data preprocessing part we will discuss what attributes will be suitable for collaborative filtering approaches.
Forming matrix for learning algorithm: Process of forming user rating matrix will be presented and we will illustrate how we form the rating value for collaborative learning algorithm.
